## Traffic Sign Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The model achieves an accuracy of ~95% on the test set, demonstrating high reliability in recognizing road signs. Although the original competition took place in 2011, this implementation showcases a modern approach to the problem.
